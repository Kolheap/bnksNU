                    <p>Banksy is an artist from the UK who is primarily known for their stencil street art. Banksy’s art is focused on criticizing society and the human condition, and has gotten a lot of attention from the levels he goes to make a point with some of his works, such as when he secretly installed a shredder into the frame of one of his works so that he could destroy the art if it was ever sold on auction. Banksy rarely sells his own art, and his public works are never done with permission beforehand.</p>

                    <h1>Is This A Banksy At Northeastern?</h1>
                    <p>This stencil art that looks visually like a Banksy was done by Jean-François Perroy, better known as Jef Aerosol, as a commission for Northeastern University. Jef’s stencils focus on highlighting the people of the street, such as beggars, random passer-bys, buskers, and ordinary people. Being that the piece wasn’t actually made by Banksy, and was paid for by Northeastern, I would not consider it a Banksy.</p>
